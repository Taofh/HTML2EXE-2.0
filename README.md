A rewrite of [HTML2EXE](https://jgc.corefn.xyz/HTML2EXE) which takes much less size and it's more customizable.

## Features
- Convert HTML files (any chromium-compatible file) and folders to EXE files
- Use internet webpages
- Custom icon
- Custom title & more
- Small program size
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
- Command line interface (CLI)
- Quick and easy to use and distribute

## How to use it
First of all, [download the program from the latest release](https://github.com/jgc777/HTML2EXE-2.0/releases/latest/). Then, drag and drop the HTML file or folder you want to convert to the program. You can also open the program to see the menu or call it from the command line (read more down here).

## GUI (Graphical User Interface)
Just open the program and a GUI will show up with all the options. You can select the HTML file or folder you want to convert (with index.html) or just continue with an empty folder. The program will show a new window with many options and the build button. Press that button and the program will start compiling, and it will show a "Finished Building!" or a "Error" with the compiler log.

## CLI (Command Line Interface))
`HTML2EXE HTML OUTPUT CONFIG`

- HTML: The HTML file or folder you want to convert. If you select a folder, make sure it contains an index.html file.
- OUTPUT (optional): The output EXE file path. If you don't specify it, the program will create "out.exe".
- CONFIG (optional): The path to the config.json file. If you don't specify it, the program will use an empty config.json file.

The program will show the log in the terminal.

## Config.json
It's a JSON file which defines some program settings. See [config_schema.json](config_schema.json) for more information.
